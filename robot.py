'''
A robot moves in a plane starting from the original point (0,0). The
robot can move toward UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT with a given steps. The
trace of robot movement is shown as the following:

UP 5
DOWN 3
LEFT 3
RIGHT 2
Â­
The numbers after the direction are steps. Please write a program to
compute the distance from current position after a sequence of movement
and original point. If the distance is a float, then just print the
nearest integer.

Solution should be 2

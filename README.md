Sample Code
===========

This module contains sample code focused on working through sample coding and computer science problems.

Problems are taking from around the Internet, interview questions, things I'm interested in, or from the book "Classic Computer Science Problems in Python" (CCSPIP).

All modules were written with Python 3.7 in mind and contain tests where ever appropriate.
